# *Behavior of Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms on Random Graphs*

Studied the behavior of Prim's and Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithms on random graphs. Considered complete graphs with n vertices where the vertices are points chosen uniformly  at random inside the unit square (2 dimensions), unit cube (3 dimensions), and hypercube (4 dimensions).

Implemented optimizations to handle large graphs and developed functions to estimate the average weight of graphs.
